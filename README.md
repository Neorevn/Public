💻 About Me

I'm currently studying to become a DevSecOps Engineer.

As a System Administrator, I enjoy building and maintaining robust systems.

In my free time, I'm an avid gamer and cinema enthusiast. My favorite games include World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and Warframe, and I'm a huge fan of mind-bending movies like The Matrix and Interstellar.

I'm also into extreme sports, including snowboarding and inline skating.
